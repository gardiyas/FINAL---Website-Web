                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notion of understanding design is about the ability of an administration or a website that can 
                    respond to a user's screen size or principles. The sensitive treatment is gradualness magnify, and it 
                    is implemented to a much longer important and increased different perspective. The conscious treatment conceives 
                    more intelligent web attendants or reinforcements based on different circumstances. It can adapt to the 
                    device/browser operative interface that disposition provide denote flawless show and perfect

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, With the improvement of technology, people misrepresent multiple new devices, for instance, 
                    transportable telephones, tablets, laptops.  And characters also create numerous new terraces and browsers, that 
                    your website's page must have outstanding agreement with those new devices to display 
                    correctly. Understanding entanglement pattern represents an necessary design current. The prevalence of 
                    understanding web purpose is performing in any unconventional protection size, meanwhile we create a webpage, that 
                    page can be meaningful and can be small. When the user opens the webpage, they will get the 
                    perfect size webpage with their symbol screen size. The secondary advantage of responsive web 
                    design takes less time than formulating an supplementary stand-alone motor-activated site, which has been the 
                    traditional approach. It will also save improvement costs and easy to advance your website.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsive web design demonstrates a way of web design that allows websites and surfaces to present on all 
                    covering or devices by automatically adapting to the screen, such as laptop, capsule or mobile phone. 
                    Understanding Web Plan helps succeed that one site could acknowledge antagonistically when viewed on
                    projects of distinctive sizes, which could be further efficient for both creators and developers.
                    Understanding entanglement scheme reaches the adaption for the organization to separate screens by using fluid, proportion-
                    based grids, flexible images, and CSS3 oracles questions. In detail, the fluid grid helps to illustrate page 
                    elements in unconventional interests depends on alternative screens or devices. Significantly, CSS3 fortunetellers queries allow the page 
                    to use plenty of CSS style rules for properties to display pages on screens.
                    As a precept about Reponsive Web Design, “Content is like water”, which helps users or visitors 
                    navigate the website easily and efficiently.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the method of consuming and “reflection.html”, I used fluid grids, which showed in 
                    construction accurately and unquestionably. Additionally, several CSS rules have been set to complete flexibility for the website to be 
                    displayed on different devices or screens. For instance, to improve pages, I designed “dropdown” to 
                    illustrate specific description for each selected product, which could not only enhance the page to be more neat and clear 
                    to understand, but also enhance the conversation and interactivity connecting visitors and websites.
                    Through assignments and fashions from the WEB course, I benefit a lot form these practical materials and assignments 
                    about JavaScript, HTML and CSS rules. While designing web apps, I should first pay consideration to easily and accurately access 
                    on unconventional devices or screens. Moreover, with flexible use of js file and CSS stylesheet, programmers could design more excellent web apps to benefit 
                    our daily life in plenty of regards, such as business, therapeutic treatment, shareholders, and technology.
